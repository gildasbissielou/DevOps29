What is a Computers 
  Computers have 2 components  = Hardware + Software
     Hardware: CPU, Screen, keyboard, mouse, harddrive, RAM, Cards   
     software: OS = Operating system, applications    

Types of Computers:  
  Personal Computers: Desktop, Laptop, IPADs, Tablets, Phones, etc. 
  work Computers: Workstations, Servers (super computers)   

Types Operating systems running in computers:
    Linux OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Servers (super computers)  
    Windows OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Laptops, Desktop
    Solaris OS []
    IOS []
    Androids []

Can I computer have more than ONE OS at once?? 99% 

What determines the choice of an OS:
Common OS are Windows, MacOS, Linux and Solaris
  -- COST  
         $400 for a windows OS licence 
         $350 for a Solaris OS licence 
         00$ for a Linux OS licence 
  -- security
       Virus attack   --- Windows  
       No Virus attack--- Linux   
  -- usage 
       Personal use [Windows]  
       Business [Linux]
  -- quality  
  -- version 
  -- speed  
  -- looks 
  -- prestige 
  -- durability

How are tasks runned/executed on computers???
How are tasks runned/executed on computers???

We are leveraging computing serviceS from AWS and GCP
 Linux OS = 
   Is an Open source OS = Free + code 

 Linus was a student who converted a problem to a business
 Solaris wasn't an open source = paid for 
 Create a free Account in AWS =  

Computer Vendors:
  Dell, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Apple
      A Dell Laptop with a windows OS is a Windows Computer  
      An HP Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 
      An LG Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 

Car Vendors:
  Toyota, Tesla, Ford, Honda

Linus was using a Solaris computer for his project.
   -- Encounter a problem running his project  
   -- He contacted the vendor but the response delayed     

Linus created the Linux OS from Solaris kernel []:

Linux is an open source OS with multiple destributions/versions.
Windows, Solaris, MacOS, etc are licenced OS.
Softwares can be:
  1. open source [Free with its source code]  
     open source softwares has more community support

  2. Free [free but without the source code(recipe)] 
  3. licenced [paid for]  

IQ: Explain your experience in Open SOURCE TECHNOLOGY?? Linux, 

IQ: How to execute tasks/workloads in Linux servers:
IQ: How to execute tasks/workloads on your computers:
     1. GUI = Graphical User Interface  = 60k
            -- This is generally a method manual to run tasks
     2. CLI = Command Line Interface =    90k
            -- This introduces tasks automation   
     3. Scripts = Are generally a collection of commands = 180k 
           -- amplifies tasks automation 

 I have windows Laptop with default Folders [Directories]    
   Folders [MY PC, document, downlaods, music, pictures, Desktop]

Tasks:
  Create 10 sub-Folders in your music folder of your windows Laptop  
  Create 10 folders using commands in your Linux Server

How and where I can buy and use Linux servers:

What is needed to drive from Houston to Dallas??
     Car [Buy, Hired/Rent, Taxi] 
We shall rent/buy computing serviceS from a Cloud Provider like:
   AWS = amazon web serviceS
   GCP 
   AZURE
  This will be ultra-fast 


     https://aws.amazon.com/ 
Amazon is the parent company of AWS 
    amazon.com 
    aws.amazon.com

We use write and deliver letters:
  ups, dhl  
  email   

 Create a free Account in AWS =  
    https://aws.amazon.com/ 

Create and Login into your AWS Account:
  userName  
  password
Create a virtual server [EC2] in YOUR AWS ACCOUNT/Cloud. 

3. Connect to your Linux server running in AWS using:
    1. ssh-client software [provide a passage]
         mobaXterm, puTTY, gitBash
         Download an install mobaXterm ssh-client software
    2. identification = userName  
    3. authentication = password or an SSH_KEY   
    4. AUTHORISATION = what you do in the server  
       Tasks that a user is AUTHORISE to execute  

AWS 90%:
   Admin[mobaXterm]  ---- > EC2-Linux 

GCP 10%:

File:
  files   
  folders=Directory
    Folders or Directories is/are containers of 
      files and sub folders/sub Directories 
  sub-folders


Windows File Structure:
root/main/parent Directory:
  This is the principal Directory where 
  other Directories are created from
 The root Directory for windows is:
    c://  
    C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Documents
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Downloads"
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Music"
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Documents\class29"
 user: simon  
    "C:\Users\Simon\Downloads"

Linux File Structure:
=====================
 What is the root Directory for Winows: c://       
 What is the root Directory for Linux: 
       / 
  Public Ip-address/RemoteHost address = 13.52.74.182  
  userName: ec2-user  
  sshKey: class29key.pem 
  ssh = secure shell = 
    use ssh protocol to securely connect to a Linux server    

    ssh -i class29key.pem ec2-user@13.52.74.182 
    ssh -i "class29key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-52-74-182.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
        = using sshKey to authenticate   
    ssh ec2-user@13.52.74.182   
        = using password to authenticate   


Linux File Structure:
=====================
   Linux file Structure start with the root Directory [/]
  
home Dir = Users 
================
   Create user account for 5 team members 
   ec2-user 
   dominion  
   simon 
   mercy 
   keren 

bin = contains of binary files[commands] 
=========================================
 - ls = list the contant of a Directory [files/sub-directoriers]
 - touch = create an empty file  
 - cd    = change Directory
 - cat   = display file content
 - pwd   = print working Directory

sbin = system/super bin
========================
 - adduser simon
 - passwd simon
What is the difference between bin and sbin in Linux? 
 sbin are binary flies only executable by the root user or users 
   with admin/elevated priviledges 
 bin files are executable by any user 

userName = root is the administrator, super user with unlimited access 
root user is created when launching a Linux server  

 GUI / CLI / Scripts   

etc = configuration files
======================== 
- /etc/passwd 
- /etc/shadow 
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
- /etc/cron.allow  

tmp - temporal file holder 
=========================

opt = installation of packages
===============================
 - maven 
 - tommcat 
 - nexu


lib  = 
====

proc 
=======
-  meminfo 
-  cpuinfo 

var
====
  /var/logs/messages 
=======================
The root is    '/'
        ls /

      ls /bin 
      ls /sbin 
      ls /tmp 
      ls /opt 
      ls /var

bin   dev  home  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
boot  etc  lib   media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr

GUI =  
CLI = COMMANDS

Basic Linux ommands:
=====================
  mkdir  = create directory     
  ls = list fil and directories 
  mkdir class29
  mkdir devops
  mkdir dirName  
  mkdir -v test 
    - v = verbose mode  
mkdir class/class27/class28/class29b
mkdir -pv class/class27/class28/class29b
      -p = Create both parent and child dir

[ec2-user@demo ~]$   mkdir class/class27/class28/class29b
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘class/class27/class28/class29b’
: No such file or directory

Ticket 001:
  Create the project dir in the below order
     DevOps/aws/git/Linux/maven/nexus
  mkdir -vp DevOps/aws/git/Linux/maven/nexus

hostname  
sudo hostname demo  
sudo su - ec2-user 
hostname

Linux is case sensitive  = 
   test / Test / TEST 
      are different files in Linux

  ls  LS Ls lS 
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ tree
-bash: tree: command not found  

Yum is a package manager for Redhat Linux 
 yum install tree

 Error: This command has to be run with
        superuser privileges
        (under the root user on most systems). 
 
  users classes:
    Normal users 
    root / superuser / admin 
    system users
       jenkins 

How can you run a command as another user?
 sudo permit a user to run commands as another user

  sudo -u paul  yum install tree
