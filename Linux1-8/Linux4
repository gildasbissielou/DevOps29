What is a Computers 
  Computers have 2 components  = Hardware + Software
     Hardware: CPU, Screen, keyboard, mouse, harddrive, RAM, Cards   
     software: OS = Operating system, applications    

Types of Computers:  
  Personal Computers: Desktop, Laptop, IPADs, Tablets, Phones, etc. 
  work Computers: Workstations, Servers (super computers)   

Types Operating systems running in computers:
    Linux OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Servers (super computers)  
    Windows OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Laptops, Desktop
    Solaris OS []
    IOS []
    Androids []

We are leveraging computing serviceS from AWS and GCP
 Linux OS = 
   Is an Open source OS = Free + code 

 Linus was a student who converted a problem to a business
 Solaris wasn't an open source = paid for 
 Create a free Account in AWS =  

Computer Vendors:
  Dell, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Apple
      A Dell Laptop with a windows OS is a Windows Computer  
      An HP Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 
      An LG Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 

Car Vendors:
  Toyota, Tesla, Ford, Honda

Linus was using a Solaris computer for his project.
   -- Encounter a problem running his project  
   -- He contacted the vendor but the response delayed     

Linus created the Linux OS from Solaris kernel []:

Linux is an open source OS with multiple destributions/versions.
Windows, Solaris, MacOS, etc are licenced OS.
Softwares can be:
  1. open source [Free with its source code]  
     open source softwares has more community support

  2. Free [free but without the source code(recipe)] 
  3. licenced [paid for]  

IQ: Explain your experience in Open SOURCE TECHNOLOGY?? Linux,

IQ: How to execute tasks/workloads on your computers:
     1. GUI = Graphical User Interface  = 60k
            -- This is generally a method manual to run tasks
     2. CLI = Command Line Interface =    90k
            -- This introduces tasks automation   
     3. Scripts = Are generally a collection of commands = 180k 
           -- amplifies tasks automation

 Create a free Account in AWS =  
    https://aws.amazon.com/ 

Create and Login into your AWS Account:
  userName  
  password
Create a virtual server [EC2] in YOUR AWS ACCOUNT/Cloud. 

3. Connect to your Linux server running in AWS using:
    1. ssh-client software [provide a passage]
         mobaXterm, puTTY, gitBash
         Download an install mobaXterm ssh-client software
    2. identification = userName  
    3. authentication = password or an SSH_KEY   
    4. AUTHORISATION = what you do in the server  
       Tasks that a user is AUTHORISE to execute  

AWS 90%:

File:
  files   
  folders=Directory
    Folders or Directories is/are containers of 
      files and sub folders/sub Directories 
  sub-folders


Windows File Structure:
root/main/parent Directory:
  This is the principal Directory where 
  other Directories are created from
 The root Directory for windows is:
    c://  
    C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Documents
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Downloads"
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Music"
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Documents\class29"
 user: simon  
    "C:\Users\Simon\Downloads"

Linux File Structure:
=====================
 What is the root Directory for Winows: c://       
 What is the root Directory for Linux: 
       / 
  Public Ip-address/RemoteHost address = 13.52.74.182  
  userName: ec2-user  
  sshKey: class29key.pem 
  ssh = secure shell = 
    use ssh protocol to securely connect to a Linux server    

    ssh -i class29key.pem ec2-user@13.52.74.182 
    ssh -i "class29key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-52-74-182.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
        = using sshKey to authenticate   
    ssh ec2-user@13.52.74.182   
        = using password to authenticate   


Linux File Structure:
=====================
   Linux file Structure start with the root Directory [/]
  
home Dir = Users 
================
   Create user account for 5 team members 
   ec2-user 
   dominion  
   simon 
   mercy 
   keren 

bin = contains of binary files[commands] 
=========================================
 - ls = list the contant of a Directory [files/sub-directoriers]
 - touch = create an empty file  
 - cd    = change Directory
 - cat   = display file content
 - pwd   = print working Directory

sbin = system/super bin
========================
 - adduser simon
 - passwd simon
What is the difference between bin and sbin in Linux? 
 sbin are binary flies only executable by the root user or users 
   with admin/elevated priviledges 
 bin files are executable by any user 

userName = root is the administrator, super user with unlimited access 
root user is created when launching a Linux server  

 GUI / CLI / Scripts   

etc = configuration files
======================== 
- /etc/passwd 
- /etc/shadow 
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
- /etc/cron.allow

Basic Linux ommands:
=====================
  mkdir  = create directory     
  ls = list fil and directories 
  mkdir class29
  mkdir devops
  mkdir dirName  
  mkdir -v test 
    - v = verbose mode  
mkdir class/class27/class28/class29b
mkdir -pv class/class27/class28/class29b
      -p = Create both parent and child dir

    rm  
cp : It will copy file contents of one file to another file.
mv : It will move or rename a file/dir
file : Determine file type.
wc : Counts the number of lines, words, bytes, or characters in a  file.
    wc fileName 
    wc -l 
    wc -w 
    wc -c 

ln: It will create the link between file
    It is use to create links of files 
    Links helps admins to easily gain access into a file   

  soft links: short cut to the file 
    ln -s  deploy.sh deploy-sl.sh 
  hard links: Is a copy of the file

Permissions: 
  Permissions are used to determine who can access a file and   
  what they can do with the file. Generally we have the following interest 
  groups:
    owner  
    Group  
    others   
Developers

What is the default umask value for the root user and NormalUser??
Because of 0022 umask value for the rootUser, files created by the 
root user will inherit 0644 permissions

Since the mask value for NormalUsers is 0002, files created by the 
normal users will inherit 0664 permissions.  

Set the umask value if all files should inherit 0666 permissions?
   umask 0000   
   -rw-rw-rw- = 666. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  0 Jul 23 17:10 file.js

group  rw = 6  rwx=7
others rw = 6  rwx=7

IQ: How can set the permissions of new files/dir?? 
  By changing the umask value.

IQ: What is the default umask value for:
      1: NormalUser  = umask is 0002
      2. rootUser    = umask is 0022


IQ: How can you change/modify the permissions of an existing file/dir ??
  By using the chmod  command.  
    chmod 600 fileName   
    chmod 600 deploy 

  useradd simon  
  groupadd devops   

   sudo useradd simon  
   sudo groupadd devops 

   sudo chown simon app.sh
   sudo chgrp devops app.sh 

   sudo chown simon:devops deploy  

   sudo chown -R simon:devops dev  
     This change ownership recursively
       to both parent and child directories
