What is a script / shell_script?
  This is file containing one or more commands 
  Shell scripts has ".sh" or ".sc" for extension. 
     hello.sh 
       echo "DevOps is great" 
       whoami 
       date  
     hello.sc  

File Naming convention :
  bash_shell_script: -- hello.sc /  greet.sh 
  java_code: [FileName.java], deploy.java 
  python_code: hello_world.py
  yaml_code: app.yml 
  xml_code: app.yml 
  html_code: index.html

1.   .#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/bash
# shell script is a collection of commands
echo "Good morning"
echo "Today is"
date
echo "Today's class was indeed great"

[simon@sc sc]$ ./hello.sh
-bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied

chmod +x hello.sh   
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 simon simon 141 Aug  2 20:11 hello.sh

How to run a script??:
By using relative path to the script/file  
   . hello.sh
   . scriptName
   sh scriptName

By using absolute path to the script/file  
   . /home/simon/sc/hello.sh
   . /home/simon/sc/scriptName 

class.sh 
#!/bin/bash
echo "DevOps is simple but requires hard work"
echo "I will soon be very rich in 2023"
echo "Becausde in 2023 I am a Sr. DevOps and Cloud Engineer"
echo "My name is":
whoami

How to write a good shell scripts or Best practices in scripting??
1. Making your scripts/code easily understood and re-usable.
   Maintain best naming convention 
     monitor_servers.sh 
     monitor_servers.py 
     deploy_app.java 
     mongo_db.sh   

2. Use comments  
    Comments explains the script/code better 
 
 filemgt.sh
    Comments: single line comments
              multi-line comment   
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
      slc.sh  
      #!/bin/sh
      # whoami
       echo "single line comments starts"
       #This script is for file management
       #Run this script only in Linux server
       #You require sudo access to run this script
       echo "single line comments ends"
       date

multi-line comment :
<<comment
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
comment 

<<mlc
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
mlc

mlc.sh 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "multi-line comments starts"
<<dev
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
dev  
echo "multi-line comments ends"
whoami 
date  

jenkins.groovy scripts:
  multi-line comment 
  /* 

  */
sinle-line comment 
  // 

xml:
   comments e
<!--     


-->

3. Varaibles make your script portable  
   greet.sh  
   name=LandmarkTechnolgy
   echo "welcome $name"
========================================================

Variables:
   user defined Variables  = UDV 
   system defined Variables = SDV 
     SDV are generally called Environmental Varaibles     
     env  
     [simon@sc sc]$  echo $HISTSIZE
     1000
     export HISTSIZE=2000  

Changing SDV:  
 1. export HISTSIZE=2000 
    CHANGES WILL ONLY be effected FOR THE CURRENT SESSION/shell

 2. vi .bashrc or vi .bash_profile  
    Changes effected in the users profile will survive a reboot 
    add:
        export HISTSIZE=700 
    run: source .bash_profile

   echo "export HISTSIZE=800" >> .bashrc 
   source .bashrc
